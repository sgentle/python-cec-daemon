This is a simple python script to pass CEC commands to uinput. The end result
is that you should be able to press buttons on your remote and have that
translate to buttons on your linux machine.

It's basically a crappy version of libcec-daemon, but libcec-daemon doesn't work
on my machine and this does, so there you go.

You need the following:

* A relatively recent Python
* LibCEC
* https://github.com/trainman419/python-cec
* https://github.com/tuomasjjrasanen/python-uinput
* The uinput kernel module loaded (try `modprobe uinput`)

You can use and modify this code under the MIT License.
